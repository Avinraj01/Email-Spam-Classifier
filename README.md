 [![MasterHead](https://dataaspirant.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Email-classifier-spacy-python-final.png)](https://Avinraj01.io)

This is an Email Spam Classifier project that uses Machine Learning to detect spam emails. The project is built using Python and includes a trained model for classification.

## Features
- Uses a pre-trained model to classify emails as spam or ham.
- Implements text vectorization for feature extraction.
- Provides a simple web-based interface (if applicable).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Email-Spam-classifier.git
   cd Email-Spam-classifier
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Enter an email text to classify it as spam or ham.
